As is common in real-life Windows pentests, we begin this box with pre-given credentials:

**Username:** `rose`

We'll start with a basic **Nmap** scan using the following command:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -sT 10.10.11.51
```
![nmap](../pics/nmap.png)
we will notice this valuable info 
```
DC01.sequel.htb
1433/tcp open  Microsoft SQL Server
389/tcp  open  LDAP
88/tcp   open  Microsoft Windows Kerberos
445/tcp  open  Microsoft-ds SMB
```
## üìÅ SMB Enumeration

Let‚Äôs enumerate the **SMB protocol** using the credentials we obtained earlier.

We'll use a tool called **`smbmap`** to list accessible shares.

```bash
smbmap -u rose -p KxEPkKe6R8su -H sequel.htb
