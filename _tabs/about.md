## ðŸ‘¤ About Me

Iâ€™m **Kareem Walid**, an Egyptian offensive security engineer and passionate hacker. I dive deep into red teaming, reverse engineering malware, Active Directory abuse, and both web and mobile application pentesting. Iâ€™m addicted to CTFs, obsessed with breaking things to understand them, and always on the hunt â€” from threat actors and ransomware gangs on the dark web to vulnerabilities buried in lines of code.

When Iâ€™m not hacking or solving CTFs, Iâ€™m automating the boring stuff â€” whether itâ€™s toolchains for pentests, custom scripts for recon, or just daily life workflows. I thrive in chaos, and I try to turn it into something useful.

Currently focusing on sharpening my skills across the offensive security spectrum â€” from initial access to advanced post-exploitation, including EDR evasion, privilege escalation, persistence, and red teaming tradecraft.

## ðŸ“š About the Blog

This blog is where Iâ€™ll be sharing writeups for **CTF challenges**, **vulnerable machines**, **real-world attack simulations**, and **personal research**. Youâ€™ll find breakdowns of vulnerabilities, walkthroughs, maybe some PoCs, malware analysis, automation scripts, and anything else I find worth documenting.

## ðŸŽ¯ The Goal

This space is my digital lab â€” a cleaner, structured version of my messy notes, where I can store everything I learn and build along the way. Whether you're here to learn something new, solve a challenge, or just see how I approach problems, I hope you find value and maybe a little inspiration.

**Stay curious, and hack everything.**
